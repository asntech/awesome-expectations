  > Our research sits at the interface between macroevolution and macroecology, and aims to understand broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. We use cutting-edge phylogenetic comparative methods (usually in R), morphological data collected from museum specimens, phylogenies, ecological data, species geographic range maps, fossils and various larger databases, to investigate a variety of topics. Current research in the group includes analyses rates and modes of evolution, convergent evolution in various taxa (including tenrecs and river dolphins), macroevolutionary analyses with fossil and living species, responses of cetaceans to past and present climate change, and biogeography and conservation of amphibians. We are advocates for Open Science and diversity in STEM.
