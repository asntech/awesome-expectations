  > What makes each species unique? In the Carvunis lab, we study the molecular mechanisms of change and innovation in evolution. This involves thinking about how genomes change over time, what cellular processes enable these changes, and how novel molecular networks emerge. We consider evolution in the light of systems biology and systems biology in the light of evolution, in order to gain a better understanding of how cells and organisms live and evolve. The research tools we rely on most are bioinformatics, yeast genetics and genomics. Generally, we strive to foster an interdisciplinary and collaborative research environment where researchers can develop creative approaches to describe, engineer and predict the genetic and network-level determinants of species-specificity.

  > Our research sits at the interface between macroevolution and macroecology, and aims to understand broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. We use cutting-edge phylogenetic comparative methods (usually in R), morphological data collected from museum specimens, phylogenies, ecological data, species geographic range maps, fossils and various larger databases, to investigate a variety of topics. Current research in the group includes analyses rates and modes of evolution, convergent evolution in various taxa (including tenrecs and river dolphins), macroevolutionary analyses with fossil and living species, responses of cetaceans to past and present climate change, and biogeography and conservation of amphibians. We are advocates for Open Science and diversity in STEM.
